% Returns the camera center matrix for a given projection matrix

% 'M' is the 3x4 projection matrix
% 'Center' is the 1x3 matrix of camera center location in world coordinates

Center = [1 1 1]; %replace this with the correct code
%In the visualization you will see that this camera location is clearly
