Training and testing the CNN did take a lot of time. So I use two computers to work simultaneously. They have different version of MATLAB. That is the reason the plot I post on my report havs different color of lines.

By the way, can I get the “late day” bonus? Since I submitted one of my project two days later, and the grade was deducted 20 points. This will make much difference.

Thank you! 

Have a nice winter break!
